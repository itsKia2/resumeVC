# ResumeVC

### Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a web application that lets users track resume revisions and organize resumes by type so that they can easily grab the best-suited resume for any given job. 

The intended audience is any job seeker that uses a resume when applying for jobs. The motivation for creating this project is that job seeking often requires fitting your resume to job requirements, which results in either many unorganized resume variations or lost revision history. This application would allow job seekers to apply to jobs more quickly and effectively.
